# ADR-0002: Build Blog Feature Set 1 (Authentication, CRUD, UX, and CI/CD)

Date: 2025-10-05  
Status: Accepted

## Context

- PRD link: <myblog-blog-feature-set-1>
- Problem/forces:
  - The project requires a robust blog feature set for graduate-level work.
  - Needs authentication, workflow-driven CRUD, and modern UX.
  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2) is required for inclusivity.
  - Role-based permissions are necessary to enforce security and workflows.
  - Advanced HTMX features (inline edits, live search) are required for dynamic interactions.
  - CI/CD pipeline is needed to ensure quality and automate testing.
  - Public repository with documentation is required for transparency and collaboration.

## Options

- **A)** Build feature set using Django’s built-in authentication, custom models, Bootstrap, HTMX, and CI/CD pipeline.
- **B)** Use a third-party solution or package for blog and authentication features.

## Decision

- We choose **A** because it provides full control, meets educational requirements, and allows for customization and compliance with accessibility and workflow needs.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Meets all requirements (authentication, CRUD, UX, accessibility, CI/CD).
  - Supports learning objectives by implementing features from scratch.
  - Provides flexibility for future enhancements.
- **Negative/Risks:**
  - Higher initial development effort.
  - More code to maintain.
  - Requires careful testing for accessibility, security, and performance.

## Validation

- **Authentication:** Login/logout implemented using Django’s built-in authentication views.
- **CRUD:** Two related models (`BlogPost` and `Category`) with full CRUD functionality.
- **Styling:** Bootstrap integrated for responsive design.
- **HTMX:** Advanced features like inline edits and live search implemented.
- **Accessibility:** Templates and interactions comply with WCAG 2.2 guidelines.
- **Permissions:** Role-based permissions enforced for CRUD operations.
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing pipeline set up using GitHub Actions.
- **Documentation:** Public repository includes clear documentation for setup, usage, and development.

## Rollback Plan

- If issues arise, rollback by reverting feature branches and disabling new workflows.
